# mitoheterogeneity

Posttranslational.m is the matlab code for the simulation of protein delivery to mitochondria that is post-translational, for two mitochondria. This code produces coefficients of variation of mitochondrial protein concentrations as mitochondrial size is varied.

Cotranslational.m is the matlab code for the simulation of protein delivery to mitochondria that is co-translational, for two mitochondria. This code produces coefficients of variation of mitochondrial protein concentrations as mitochondrial size is varied.

ManyFragments.m is the code for the simulation of co-translational protein delivery to dynamic mitochondrial networks. This code produces fragment sizes and the concentration.
